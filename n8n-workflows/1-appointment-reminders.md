# Workflow 1: Appointment Reminder System

## Overview
Automatically schedule appointments from form submissions, add to calendar, send SMS/email reminders, and track attendance.

## Workflow Components

### Step 1: Webhook Trigger
```json
{
  "name": "Appointment Request",
  "type": "webhook",
  "path": "/appointment-request",
  "method": "POST"
}
```

### Step 2: Validate & Parse Data
**IF Node** - Check required fields:
- Name
- Phone
- Email  
- Preferred Date/Time
- Appointment Type (Assessment, Follow-up, Placement)

### Step 3: Google Calendar Integration
**Google Calendar Node:**
- **Operation**: Create Event
- **Calendar**: Forward Horizon Appointments
- **Event Details**:
  ```
  Title: {{appointmentType}} - {{veteranName}}
  Start: {{preferredDateTime}}
  Duration: 1 hour
  Description: 
    Veteran: {{veteranName}}
    Phone: {{phone}}
    Email: {{email}}
    Type: {{appointmentType}}
    Notes: {{additionalNotes}}
  Location: {{location || "Forward Horizon Office"}}
  ```
- **Add Attendees**: Veteran email + Case worker email
- **Send Notifications**: Yes
- **Add Reminder**: 24 hours before

### Step 4: Create Confirmation Message
**Code Node** - Generate personalized message:
```javascript
const appointmentDate = new Date($json.preferredDateTime);
const formattedDate = appointmentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
  weekday: 'long',
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
  hour: '2-digit',
  minute: '2-digit'
});

const message = {
  sms: `Hi ${$json.veteranName}, your ${$json.appointmentType} appointment is confirmed for ${formattedDate} at Forward Horizon. Reply CANCEL to cancel or RESCHEDULE to change. Call (310) 488-5280 with questions.`,
  
  email: {
    subject: `Appointment Confirmed: ${$json.appointmentType} on ${formattedDate}`,
    body: `
Dear ${$json.veteranName},

Your appointment has been confirmed:

üìÖ Date: ${formattedDate}
üìç Location: ${$json.location || 'Forward Horizon - 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA'}
üìã Type: ${$json.appointmentType}

What to bring:
- Photo ID
- DD-214 (if first appointment)
- Any relevant documentation
- List of questions

Need to reschedule? Call us at (310) 488-5280 or reply to this email.

We look forward to seeing you!

Best regards,
Forward Horizon Team
    `
  }
};

return message;
```

### Step 5: Send Confirmations
**Parallel Branches:**

**Branch 1 - SMS via Twilio:**
- To: {{phone}}
- Body: {{message.sms}}
- From: Your Twilio number

**Branch 2 - Email:**
- To: {{email}}
- Subject: {{message.email.subject}}
- Body: {{message.email.body}}

### Step 6: Schedule Reminder (24 hours before)
**Wait Node:**
- Resume: At specific time
- Time: {{appointmentDate - 24 hours}}

**Then Send Reminder:**
- SMS: "Reminder: Your appointment is tomorrow at {time}. Reply CONFIRM to confirm attendance."
- Email: Similar reminder with appointment details

### Step 7: Track Response
**Webhook Node** - Listen for SMS replies:
- CONFIRM ‚Üí Update calendar event with "Confirmed"
- CANCEL ‚Üí Delete calendar event, notify staff
- RESCHEDULE ‚Üí Trigger rescheduling workflow

### Step 8: Day-of Reminder (2 hours before)
**Wait Node:**
- Resume: {{appointmentDate - 2 hours}}

**Send Final Reminder:**
- SMS: "Your appointment is in 2 hours at Forward Horizon. See you soon!"

### Step 9: No-Show Follow-up
**Wait Node:**
- Resume: {{appointmentDate + 1 hour}}

**Check Attendance:**
- If marked as no-show in calendar
- Send follow-up: "We missed you today. Please call (310) 488-5280 to reschedule."
- Create task for case worker to follow up

## Implementation in N8N

1. **Create New Workflow** in N8N dashboard
2. **Add Webhook trigger node**
3. **Connect Google Calendar** (requires OAuth)
4. **Set up Twilio** (requires account SID & auth token)
5. **Configure email** (use existing SMTP)
6. **Add wait nodes** for scheduling
7. **Test with sample data**

## Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Add to your .env file
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id
APPOINTMENT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://jumaanebey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/appointments
```

## Testing the Workflow

Test command:
```bash
curl -X POST https://jumaanebey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/appointments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "veteranName": "John Smith",
    "phone": "+13105551234",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com",
    "appointmentType": "Initial Assessment",
    "preferredDateTime": "2025-01-30T14:00:00",
    "location": "Forward Horizon Main Office",
    "additionalNotes": "Needs wheelchair access"
  }'
```

## Metrics to Track
- Appointment confirmation rate
- No-show rate
- Reminder effectiveness
- Response rates to SMS
- Average time to reschedule

## Next Steps
Once this is working, we can:
1. Add video appointment options (Zoom integration)
2. Integrate with case management system
3. Add automated intake form sending
4. Create appointment preparation checklists
5. Generate appointment summary reports
